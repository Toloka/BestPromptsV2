<h3>About the Task</h3>
<p>You will be given two sets consisting of four images each. The both represent AI generated artworks based on the description you see above these images. These two sets are generated using the same description but different neural network's settings. We try to find a setting that produces the best images (aesthetically). So, <b>your task is to compare two sets and choose the best in your opinion</b>.</p>
<h3>How to Complete the Tasks</h3>
<div>1. Look at the textual description</div>
<div>2. Look at the images <b>"A"</b> (left on the desktop)</div>
<div>3. Look at the images <b>"B"</b></div>
<div>4. Click to zoom-in an image</div>
<div>5. Usually, these images represent some digital art-style pictures. You need to define which set <b>(a)</b> looks more professional;&nbsp;<b>(b)</b> has less artefacts (third hand, second head, etc);&nbsp;<b>(c)</b> follows the description correctly.</div>
<div>6. Click on "A" if you think set A is the best one, "B" otherwise</div>
<div>7. If both sets look similar, choose whatever you want</div>
<div>8. If images do not load or some error shows up, try this: <b>1)</b> Change browser (to Google Chrome) <b>2)</b> Skip the page <b>3)</b> If the problem holds, please write us back but <b>do not click at random: this will lead to your suspension.</b></div>
<div>
    <h3>What can lead to your ban</h3>
</div>
<div>Despite the fact that the task is pretty much subjective (there is, obviously, no "correct" opinion most of the times), there are some pretty obvious examples and <b>we track your responses to them</b>. Also, we look manually at your responses and can <b>suspend you</b> if we see you're trying to cheat.</div>
<div>Overall, the task must be fun, and does not require any special skills, so there is no point to cheat or try to spam.</div>
